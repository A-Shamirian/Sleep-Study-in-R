# Lifestyle Factors Affecting Sleep Quality

### Sleep Efficiency Dataset obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equilibriumm/sleep-efficiency.

## Description
In this project, we use the stepwise method to find the best model to explain sleep efficiency. Our comprehensive analysis of various factors influencing sleep efficiency has yielded several key findings. First, individual factors such as caffeine and alcohol consumption were found to be insignificant on their own, while smoking was identified as a detriment to sleep quality. Conversely, a higher frequency of exercise demonstrated a positive impact on sleep quality. Second, examining the influence of age and gender on sleep revealed that older individuals generally experience better sleep quality, and men tend to achieve better sleep than women. Third, in exploring the temporal aspects of sleep, bedtime and sleep duration were found to be insignificant on their own, with significance emerging when considering interactions such as Awakenings:Age, DeepSleep:Awakenings, and SleepDuration:AlcoholConsumption. Lastly, investigating associations between various sleep metrics uncovered that a higher percentage of deep sleep and REM sleep, as well as an increased number of awakenings, were associated with improved sleep efficiency.
