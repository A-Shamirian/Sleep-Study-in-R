# Sleep-Study-in-R

Developed a multiple linear regression model in R using sleep efficiency data. The optimal model was selected through stepwise search and evaluation of adjusted R-squared, AIC, BIC, and Mallow's CP criteria. Interaction and higher-order terms were also explored. The model's predictive power was tested against actual data.
